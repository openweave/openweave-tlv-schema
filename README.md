# OpenWeave TLV Schema Package

Python-based libraries and tools for working with Weave TLV schemas.

The _Weave TLV Schema_ language provides a simple textual format for describing data and other
constructs typically used in Weave-based applications. Its primary use is to describe the
structure of data encoded in Weave TLV format, a compact binary data format targeting
constrained IoT devices.  However, TLV schemas can also describe higher level Weave constructs
such as Weave profiles, message types and status codes.  Emphasis is placed on the
inherent readability of the language, making it well suited for use in protocol documentation
and formal specifications.  Additionally, tools are provided for generating source code that
can be used when building Weave-based applications.
